Welcome to **Animated UI Delights**, a curated collection of modern, delightful UI animations built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and the powerful Anime.js library. This project serves as a practical gallery and learning resource, offering copy-pasteable examples for developers looking to enhance their web applications with engaging user experiences.

## üéØ Project Vision

This project aims to be the go-to resource for React developers who want to add smooth, meaningful animations to their applications. We believe that well-crafted animations can significantly improve user experience when used thoughtfully.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Diverse Animation Categories:** 
  - Button animations (ripple, pulse, shifting, icon rotation)
  - Card and tile animations (hover effects, entry animations)
  - Form and input animations (focus effects, validation feedback)
  - Loaders and spinners (various styles and effects)
  - Modal and dialog transitions (entry/exit animations)
  - Toast notifications (animated notifications with stacking)
  - Draggable elements (simple drag, spring physics, snapping)
  - Scroll-triggered animations (fade in, slide up, scale up)
  - Text animations (typewriter, gradient effects, reveal animations)
  - Hero text animations (staggered, glitch, masked effects)

- **Copy-Paste Friendly:** Each example comes with clean, well-documented code snippets
- **Interactive Previews:** See animations in action directly within the gallery
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with industry-standard tools for optimal performance
- **Responsive Design:** All animations work seamlessly across different screen sizes

## üêõ Known Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **Anime.js Import Inconsistency** 
   - Some components use `import anime from 'animejs'` while others use `import * as anime from 'animejs'`
   - Build fails due to default export not being available
   - **Status:** Partially fixed, some components still need updates

2. **TypeScript Errors**
   - `anime.default is not a function` errors in runtime
   - Type definition conflicts between different import styles
   - **Impact:** Prevents successful builds and deployments

### Minor Issues
1. **Animation Performance**
   - Some complex animations may cause frame drops on lower-end devices
   - Need to implement `will-change` CSS properties strategically

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Some animations don't scale well on mobile devices
   - Touch interactions need refinement

3. **Documentation**
   - Code examples in some components need better comments
   - Missing usage instructions for complex animations

6. **Accessibility:** Add support for `prefers-reduced-motion` and other a11y features

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (avoid custom CSS when possible)
- Ensure all animations are smooth and performant
- Add proper TypeScript types for all props and functions

#### Animation Best Practices
- Keep animations under 300ms for micro-interactions
- Use easing functions that feel natural (`easeOutQuad`, `easeInOutSine`)
- Ensure animations don't interfere with user interactions
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices
- Consider users with motion sensitivity

#### Component Structure
```typescript
// Example component structure
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import * as anime from "animejs"; // Use this import style

interface ComponentProps {
  // Define clear props with TypeScript
}

const AnimatedComponent = ({ ...props }: ComponentProps) => {
  const elementRef = useRef<HTMLElement>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Animation logic here
    if (!elementRef.current) return;
    
    const animation = anime({
      targets: elementRef.current,
      // Animation properties
    });
    
    return () => animation.pause(); // Cleanup
  }, []);
  
  return (
    // JSX with proper ref and classes
  );
};

export default AnimatedComponent;

// Export code snippet for documentation
export const componentCode = `...`;
```
