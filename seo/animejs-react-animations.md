# Integrating Anime.js with React for Smooth Animations

**Target Keywords:** Anime.js React, React animation library, JavaScript animation, smooth animations React

## Introduction

Anime.js is a lightweight JavaScript animation library with a simple yet powerful API. Integrating it into React applications allows for complex, performant, and highly customizable animations beyond what CSS transitions alone can offer. This article explores best practices for using Anime.js within React components.

## Why Anime.js in React?

*   **Fine-grained Control:** Animate almost any CSS property, SVG attribute, or JavaScript object.
*   **Performance:** Optimized for speed.
*   **Sequencing & Timeline:** Easily create complex choreographed animation sequences.
*   **Flexibility:** Works well with React's component lifecycle and state management.

## Core Concepts

1.  **Using `useRef`:** Attach refs to the DOM elements you want to animate.
2.  **Using `useEffect`:** Trigger animations when components mount, update, or based on state changes. Ensure proper cleanup.
3.  **Targeting Elements:** Use refs (`targetRef.current`) as targets for Anime.js.
4.  **Cleanup:** Return a cleanup function from `useEffect` to stop animations or revert elements when the component unmounts.

## Example: Fade-in Animation on Mount

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import anime from 'animejs';

const FadeInComponent = () => {
  const elementRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (elementRef.current) {
      anime({
        targets: elementRef.current,
        opacity: [0, 1],
        duration: 1000,
        easing: 'easeInOutQuad'
      });
    }
    // No cleanup needed for simple one-off animation
  }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures it runs only on mount

  return <div ref={elementRef} style={{ opacity: 0 }}>Hello!</div>;
};
```

## Advanced Techniques

*   **State-Driven Animations:** Trigger Anime.js timelines based on changes in component state.
*   **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Combine with `IntersectionObserver` (as shown in this project's examples).
*   **Staggering Animations:** Easily apply animations to multiple elements with delays.
*   **Dynamic Values:** Use functions to calculate animation values dynamically.

## Conclusion

Anime.js provides a robust solution for creating sophisticated animations in React. By leveraging `useRef` and `useEffect`, developers can seamlessly integrate its power into their component-based architecture.
