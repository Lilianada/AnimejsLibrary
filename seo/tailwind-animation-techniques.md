## Introduction

Tailwind CSS is primarily known for utility-first styling, but it also provides excellent tools for creating CSS animations. This article covers techniques from simple transitions to custom keyframe animations, all within the Tailwind ecosystem.

## Transitions

Tailwind's core transition utilities (`transition`, `duration-*`, `ease-*`, `delay-*`) are perfect for simple state changes (e.g., hover, focus).

```html
<button class="transition duration-300 ease-in-out transform hover:scale-110 hover:bg-blue-700 ...">
  Hover Me
</button>
```

## Built-in Animations

Tailwind includes utilities for common animations like spin, ping, pulse, and bounce.

```html
<div class="animate-spin h-5 w-5 mr-3 ..."></div> <!-- Spinner -->
<span class="animate-ping absolute inline-flex h-full w-full rounded-full bg-sky-400 opacity-75"></span> <!-- Ping effect -->
```

## Custom Keyframe Animations

For more complex sequences, define custom keyframes and animations in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      keyframes: {
        slideIn: {
          '0%': { transform: 'translateX(-100%)', opacity: '0' },
          '100%': { transform: 'translateX(0)', opacity: '1' },
        },
        shimmer: {
          '0%, 100%': { backgroundPosition: '-1000px 0' },
          '50%': { backgroundPosition: '1000px 0' },
        }
      },
      animation: {
        slideIn: 'slideIn 1s ease-out forwards',
        shimmer: 'shimmer 2s infinite linear',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then apply using `animate-*` utilities:

```html
<div class="animate-slideIn ...">Slides In</div>
<div class="animate-shimmer bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-gray-300 to-transparent ...">Shimmer Placeholder</div>
```

## Combining with JavaScript

Use JavaScript to dynamically add/remove animation classes based on events or state, triggering Tailwind-defined animations.

## Performance Considerations

*   Prefer animating `transform` and `opacity` as they are typically handled by the browser's compositor thread.
*   Be mindful of animation complexity on less powerful devices.

## Conclusion

Tailwind CSS provides a flexible and powerful way to implement animations, from simple transitions to complex keyframed sequences, all while maintaining a utility-first workflow.
